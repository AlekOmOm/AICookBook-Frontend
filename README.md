### Project Overview: AI-Enhanced Cookbook Application

**Objective:**
- To create a proof-of-concept system that integrates AI-driven functionalities to enhance a cookbook application. 
- The project emphasizes user-customized recipe recommendations and streamlined shopping list generation based on available ingredients and user preferences.

**Core Functionality:**
1. **Ingredients Management**: 
	- Users log in, upload, or update their list of available ingredients.
2. **'Choose' - Recipe Suggestions**: 
   - The system suggests recipes using AI recommendations based on:
	   - user profile preferences 
	   - and available ingredients.
   - Recipes Categorization:
	   - “Best Use” (recipes using at least 50% of available ingredients) 
	   - “Good Alternatives” (recipes using at least 25%).
3. **'Shop' - Shopping List Generation**: 
	- Once a recipe is chosen, the system generates a shopping list for missing ingredients.
4. **'Cook' - Retrieve Recipe Instructions**
	- precondition: 
		- recipe chose + shopping done
		- Instructions included in the initial Generation of Recipe, which is temp-saved  
	-  System retrieves Recipe Instruction for easy Cooking of recipe. 
			


**User Workflow:**
1. **Login**: Access the application.
2. **Setup Ingredients**: Users add or update their ingredient list.
3. **Intent Selection**: Users choose an intent such as "Explore" (new recipes) or "Use Known" (based on familiar ingredients), and set or customize preferences.
4. **Recipe Exploration**: Based on filters (e.g., vegetarian, work time), users receive tailored recipe recommendations.
5. **Recipe Details and Shopping List**: Upon recipe selection, detailed instructions and an auto-generated shopping list are provided.
